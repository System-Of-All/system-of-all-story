# Governance Framework

System Of All Story operates under a structured governance model designed to ensure editorial integrity, operational accountability, and transparent decision‑making across the platform. This framework defines the roles, responsibilities, and oversight mechanisms that guide both editorial and technical operations.

## 1. Governance Principles

All governance decisions follow these core principles:

- Editorial independence
- Transparency and accountability
- Security and responsible disclosure
- Compliance with legal and ethical standards
- Separation of editorial, advertising, and technical functions

---

## 2. Editorial Governance

### 2.1 Editorial Authority
The editorial team maintains full authority over:

- Content approval
- Fact‑checking and verification
- Corrections and retractions
- Category structure and editorial direction

Advertising partners, subscribers, and institutional clients have **no influence** over editorial decisions.

### 2.2 Editorial Review Workflow
1. Contributor submits content  
2. Editorial review for accuracy and tone  
3. Source verification  
4. Compliance review (crypto, medical, or political as applicable)  
5. Approval and publication  

### 2.3 Corrections & Retractions
Corrections follow the workflow defined in **EDITORIAL_POLICY.md** and are:

- Logged
- Timestamped
- Publicly visible

Retractions occur only when content fails verification standards.

---

## 3. Advertising Governance

Advertising operations are governed by:

- ADVERTISING_POLICY.md  
- Legal compliance requirements  
- Internal due diligence procedures  

The advertising team cannot override editorial decisions.

All sponsored content must be labeled and undergo compliance review.

## 4. Technical & Infrastructure Governance

### 4.1 Repository Management
- All merges require review  
- Production deployments follow version‑controlled workflows  
- Security updates require approval from designated maintainers  

### 4.2 Security Oversight
Security governance includes:

- Vulnerability reporting procedures  
- Incident response timelines  
- Infrastructure access controls  
- Third‑party integration review  

Defined in **SECURITY.md**.

## 5. Compliance Governance

Compliance oversight ensures adherence to:

- Legal disclaimers  
- Advertising regulations  
- Data protection requirements  
- Medical and political neutrality standards  

Compliance officers may request content review or removal if necessary.

## 6. Institutional Access Governance

Institutional subscribers receive:

- Priority access to research  
- Structured briefings  
- Multi‑seat access  

They do **not** receive:

- Editorial influence
