# Advertising Policy

System Of All Story accepts advertising partnerships that align with our editorial integrity, legal obligations, and audience expectations. This policy defines the standards, due diligence requirements, and compliance rules governing all advertising relationships, including crypto‑related promotions.



## 1. Advertising Principles

All advertising must adhere to:

- Legal compliance across relevant jurisdictions
- Transparency and clear disclosure
- No misleading, fraudulent, or deceptive claims
- No guaranteed returns or investment promises
- Clear separation between editorial content and paid promotion

Sponsored content is always labeled.



## 2. Crypto Advertising Standards

Crypto‑related advertising is subject to enhanced scrutiny due to regulatory risk.

### 2.1 Prohibited Claims
Advertisers may not:

- Guarantee profits or returns
- Promise future token price increases
- Present speculative projections as certainty
- Imply regulatory approval where none exists
- Use misleading terminology (e.g., “risk‑free,” “guaranteed yield”)

### 2.2 Required Disclosures
All crypto advertisements must include:

- Investment risk disclosure
- Statement that digital assets may lose value
- Jurisdiction‑specific disclaimers where required
- Disclosure of any token allocations or vested interests

### 2.3 Due Diligence Requirements
Before acceptance, crypto advertisers must provide:

- Project website and whitepaper
- Team verification (public identities or corporate entity)
- Smart contract audit (if applicable)
- Legal entity information
- Contact details for compliance review

System Of All Story reserves the right to reject any advertiser at its discretion.



## 3. Sponsored Content Rules

Sponsored articles, interviews, or features must:

- Be clearly labeled as “Sponsored”
- Not influence editorial independence
- Undergo compliance review
- Avoid investment advice or medical claims
- Include advertiser disclosures where relevant

Editorial staff retain full authority to reject or modify sponsored submissions.



## 4. Disallowed Advertising Categories

We do not accept advertising for:

- Fraudulent or unverified crypto projects
- High‑yield investment schemes (HYIPs)
- Unlicensed financial services
- Medical treatments or diagnostic claims
- Political campaigns or partisan organizations
- Classified or unverifiable intelligence‑related claims



## 5. Review & Approval Workflow

1. Advertiser submits proposal  
2. Compliance review (crypto, legal, or medical as applicable)  
3. Editorial review for accuracy and tone  
4. Contractual approval  
5. Publication with required disclosures  

Failure to meet any requirement results in rejection.



## 6. Enforcement & Removal

System Of All Story may remove advertisements if:

- New information indicates fraud or regulatory violations  
- Advertiser fails to meet disclosure requirements  
- Content is deemed misleading or harmful  
- Legal authorities issue warnings or notices  

We reserve full discretion to terminate advertising relationships.



## 7. Transparency Commitment

We maintain:

- Clear labeling of sponsored content  
- Separation between editorial and advertising teams  
- Public documentation of advertising standards  
- Consistent enforcement of compliance rules  

System Of All Story prioritizes reader trust above revenue.
